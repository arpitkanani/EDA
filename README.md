# 📘 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

A collection of EDA projects performed on multiple datasets.  
Each project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and insights.

## 📂 Datasets Used (Short Descriptions)

### **1. Red Wine Quality Dataset**
Contains chemical properties of red wine such as acidity, sulphates, alcohol, and a quality score (0–10).  
Used to identify which features influence wine quality.

### **2. Flight Price Dataset**
Includes airline, route, duration, date of journey, total stops, and ticket price.  
Used to understand factors affecting airfare.

### **3. Student Performance Dataset**
Contains demographic information, parental education, exam preparation, and exam scores (math, reading, writing).  
Used to analyze patterns in student achievement.

### **4. Google Play Store Dataset**
Includes app details such as category, rating, reviews, installs, size, price, and content rating.  
Used to study app trends and user engagement.

# 📊 Project Summaries

## **1. Red Wine Quality – EDA**
- Cleaned dataset and checked missing values  
- Analyzed chemical feature distributions  
- Visualized correlations using heatmap and scatter plots  
- **Insight:** Higher alcohol increases quality; high volatile acidity reduces quality

---

## **2. Flight Price – EDA + Encoding**
- Extracted journey and time-based features  
- Applied Label and One-Hot Encoding  
- Visualized price variation by airline, route, duration  
- **Insight:** Airline type and number of stops majorly affect ticket price

---

## **3. Student Performance – EDA**
- Checked score distributions across subjects  
- Compared performance based on gender, race, parental education  
- Created histograms, boxplots, and pairplots  
- **Insight:** Test preparation and parental education improve scores

---

## **4. Google Play Store – EDA + Feature Engineering**
- Cleaned install count, reviews, size, and price fields  
- Engineered new features: size groups, install buckets, price groups  
- Visualized category distribution, rating trends, install patterns  

### ✔ Key Questions Answered
**1. Which category has the largest number of installations?**  
Games and Communication categories have the highest installs.

**2. What are the top 5 most installed apps in each major category?**  
Extracted top apps per category (e.g., WhatsApp, Messenger, Subway Surfers, etc.).

**3. How many apps have a perfect 5 rating?**  
Only a small number of apps achieve a perfect 5.0 rating.
